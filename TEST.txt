Comments:

Overall we had a good indexing system and used binary structures which result in quick search times.
We found consistent result counts and query times.

ACM had a bug where it said it had only one result but it is because we were not using tokenize in the search loop.
playstation has only four results.
in the arms of an angel has really high frequency count and 33 results.
